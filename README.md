# This repo is for my javascipt test

## Overview

The purpose of this test is to evaluate my web development knowledge with this online test. JavaScript is the leading language for front-end coding of web applications, but it's also used to customize the back-end. I was ordered to complete this front-end JavaScript challenge and show my ability to deliver a working and elegant solution, while respecting the given boundaries and requirements.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered:

- HTML

  - I got an HTML body element where nothing was to be changed.
  - I added a CSS link tag.
  - I added a JS script tag.
  - I added an HTML doctype structure.

- CSS

  - Styling the body elements without the use of a class or ID.

- Javascript

  - I got a starting skeleton of a JavaScript class component.
  - I got a JSON dataset to work with.
  - I made the JS modular for better developer experience.
  - I added a file structure.

## Test Objectives

What is appreciate:

- Clean and readable code.
- Quality and maintainable code.
- Attention to details.
- How strong and up-to-date my JS skills are.

## Functional requirements

I don't think I'm allowed to share the functional requirements, which can be asked internally.

## The rules of the game

1. This is a personal test, don't share this page with friends or online.
2. You cannot modify the HTML source.
3. Use CSS, SCSS or Sass for styling, no JS.
4. Use only pure JS, external frameworks or libraries (e.g. jQuery) are not allowed.
5. You don't have to support retired browsers, ECMA 2019 is allowed!
